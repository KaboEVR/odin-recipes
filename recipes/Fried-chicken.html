        <h3>Instructions for Brine and Frying</h3>
        <h5>Brine</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with 5 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Add the sugar, salt, bay leaf, red pepper flakes, and orange peel. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until the sugar and salt dissolve. Let cool. </li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl and cover with the cooled brine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 10 hours and up to 24.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels; discard the brine. </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Frying</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir the flour, cornmeal, potato chips, black pepper, garlic powder, salt, cayenne, and baking powder. Transfer to a large shallow dish. Place another large shallow dish next to the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Place a wire rack or pan next to the two dishes; this will be where you set your battered chicken.</li>
            <li>Take one wing and submerge in the buttermilk. Lift and let any excess drip back into the dish. Roll the wing in the flour mixture, coating it completely. Place the battered chicken wing on the wire rack or pan and repeat with the remaining wings.</li>
            <li>Let the wings dry for 20 to 30 minutes before frying.</li>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350°F. Place a wire rack over a plate or line a pan with brown paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, carefully fry the wings. Do not crowd; otherwise, they’ll become greasy. Once the chicken is added, the oil’s temperature will drop to between 300°F to 320°F. Watch and adjust the heat to maintain a consistent 350°F temperature.</li>
            <li>Fry the wings for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden. If the chicken is getting too dark, reduce the heat. Transfer the wings to the prepared rack or pan to drain. Season generously with salt.</li>
            <li>Let the oil come back to temperature before adding the next batch; repeat with the remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Serve the wings with plenty of hot sauce (if using) or over buttermilk waffles, hot or cold, however you like them.</li>
        </ol>
