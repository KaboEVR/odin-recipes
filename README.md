# odin-recipes
This is my first ever HTML website project. The project idea was given to me by the TheOdinProject course.

This project may get updated in  the future when I learn more about web development, however, it may also remain as it is when you view this.
I would not like to update it too much so I can use this initial site as a marker for me in the future to look back at when im done with the course.

The project includes a few food recipes that I have snatched from the internet. I have also included my own pizza recipe. 
I have attached an external css stylesheet to make it a little bit more visually appealing. The stylesheet is not too complicated as it uses the basic selectors that we learn in the CSS foundation section of TOP. It likely is messy with many errors and inefficient layouts. 


Please do not look at the CSS file yet if you have not completed the HTML project by yourself. I am also a beginner at this point so my CSS stylesheet is not a prime example to work off. If anything it could be for checking your knowledge and maybe you could even improve it.  


Thank you for opening up my project if you are still learning at TOP. Good luck on your journey! Hopefully I have helped you in someway.
